## What's different about this config as compared to nvchad?

I've added some plugins which might help increase your workflow too. You can have a look at my `lua/custom/plugins/init.lua` to see custom plugins I've added.

I've currently added these plugins:
 - [lightspeed](https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim) - To quickly jump to a word on the visible screen
 - [peek.nvim](https://github.com/toppair/peek.nvim) - For markdown preview
 - [null-ls.nvim](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) - For codeactions, diagnostics
